Infrastructure
==============

In the previous chapter we talked about the highly configurable nature of VMs. Infrastructure is the Hardware of our servers and the Network of our resources.

These are all things we could setup ourselves, but a huge benefit of Azure, and other Cloud Services Providers is they manage many of these things for you.

When you provision a VM you simply select the RAM, CPU, image, and disk size, and Azure handles the rest. They own the actual server, and have taken care of all of the networking for you. The service provided is considered Infrastructure As A Service or IaaS for short. The Hardware, and networking is still configurable to you, but it's provided as a service from Azure, or any other Cloud Services Provider.

You can most certainly buy your own server, but then you would have to set it up, connect it to the internet, maintain it, and upgrade it once it is no longer powerful enough to meet your needs. When you use IaaS these concerns are taken care of for you. You pay to rent the server, and the Cloud Service Provider handles the rest.
