Operations Introduction
=======================

Throughout this class we have focused primarily on development. Our attention has been on learning and practicing the concepts necessary to develop an application that someone could use.

Now that we have the skills necessary to build an application we face a new challenge best represented by the question: How do we get our application to our users?

We have created both console application, and web applications throughout this class, but to run our projects we have leaned heavily on our IDE Visual Studio. We simply click the green run button and our project springs to life! This is handy when we are developing our projects because after each small change we typically want to check our progress. However, it is not realistic to run our application from Visual Studio on our local machines when our intended users aren't using this local machine. We will need some way to pack up our code, and take it to our users.

The following week of concepts leaves the world of ``Development`` as our focus shifts to ``Operations``.

``Development`` is the process of gathering requirements, writing code, testing code, designing UI/UX, designing model diagrams, configuring an application to work with external application dependencies like MySQL, etc.

``Operations`` is the process of standing up infrastructure, networking, deploying applications, configuring services, etc.

In the current era of technology you may often encounter the mashup term ``DevOps`` which is a combination of the two discplines. Many programmers fall into this bucket of ``DevOps`` wherein they need to understand how to both develop applications, and deploy them to, and configure the various infrastructure.

We will learn about the necesesary concepts and steps we must take within the realm of ``Operations`` to bring our project to our intended users.
